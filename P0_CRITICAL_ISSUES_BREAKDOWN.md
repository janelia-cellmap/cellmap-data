# P0 Critical Issues Breakdown - Week 1 Days 3-5

## Overview
This document provides detailed breakdown of the 3 P0 critical issues identified in the technical debt audit that must be resolved during Week 1 Days 3-5 of Phase 1 execution.

## P0 Issue #1: Index Out of Bounds Coordinate Transformation Hack

### Location
- **File**: `src/cellmap_data/dataset.py` (line 510)
- **File**: `src/cellmap_data/dataset_writer.py` (line 320)

### Problem Description
Both `CellMapDataset` and `CellMapDatasetWriter` contain identical "hacky temporary fix" code that handles `ValueError` exceptions when attempting to unravel array indices for coordinate center calculation. The hack simply clamps to the maximum index instead of properly handling the root cause.

### Code Context
```python
# In dataset.py line 510 and dataset_writer.py line 320
try:
    center = np.unravel_index(
        idx, [self.sampling_box_shape[c] for c in self.axis_order]
    )
except ValueError:
    # TODO: This is a hacky temprorary fix. Need to figure out why this is happening
    logger.error(f"Index {idx} out of bounds for dataset {self} of length {len(self)}")
    logger.warning(f"Returning closest index in bounds")
    center = [self.sampling_box_shape[c] - 1 for c in self.axis_order]
```

### Impact
- **Severity**: P0 Critical
- **Data Corruption Risk**: High - Silently returns incorrect coordinates instead of failing fast
- **Training Impact**: Produces inconsistent/wrong training data that could corrupt model training
- **Performance Impact**: None directly, but masks underlying indexing issues

### Root Cause Analysis Required
1. **Investigation needed**: Why are indices out of bounds being passed to `__getitem__`?
2. **Possible causes**:
   - Race conditions in multi-threaded data loading
   - Incorrect `__len__` calculation 
   - Sampler generating invalid indices
   - Shape calculation errors in `sampling_box_shape`

### Resolution Strategy (Day 3-4)
1. **Day 3**: Root cause analysis
   - Add comprehensive logging to track index generation vs valid ranges
   - Trace through `__len__`, sampling logic, and coordinate calculations
   - Identify exact conditions causing out-of-bounds access
   
2. **Day 4**: Implement proper fix
   - Fix underlying indexing logic instead of clamping
   - Add proper bounds checking with informative error messages
   - Add unit tests covering edge cases
   - Remove hack code once proper fix is verified

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Root cause identified and documented
- [ ] Proper fix implemented that prevents out-of-bounds access
- [ ] Hack code removed from both files
- [ ] Unit tests added covering edge cases
- [ ] No silent data corruption in coordinate calculation

## P0 Issue #2: Coordinate Transformation Performance Bottleneck

### Location
- **File**: `src/cellmap_data/dataset.py` (line 524)

### Problem Description
TODO comment indicates that coordinate transformations are being applied inefficiently at the item level instead of the dataset level, causing major performance bottlenecks when duplicate reference frames require the same transformations.

### Code Context
```python
# Line 524 in dataset.py __getitem__ method
# TODO: Should do as many coordinate transformations as possible at the dataset level 
# (duplicate reference frame images should have the same coordinate transformations) 
# --> do this per array, perhaps with CellMapArray object

def get_input_array(array_name: str) -> tuple[str, torch.Tensor]:
    self.input_sources[array_name].set_spatial_transforms(spatial_transforms)
    array = self.input_sources[array_name][center]  # Transformation applied here per item
    return array_name, array.squeeze()[None, ...]
```

### Impact
- **Severity**: P0 Critical
- **Performance Impact**: Major - Repeated coordinate transformations on every `__getitem__` call
- **Scalability Impact**: Becomes worse with larger datasets and more complex transformations
- **Resource Usage**: Excessive CPU/memory usage for redundant calculations

### Root Cause Analysis
- Spatial transformations are calculated and applied per-sample instead of being cached/shared
- No caching mechanism for duplicate reference frame transformations
- Coordinate transformation matrix calculations repeated unnecessarily

### Resolution Strategy (Day 4-5)
1. **Day 4**: Design improved architecture
   - Analyze current transformation pipeline
   - Design `CellMapArray` object as suggested in TODO
   - Plan caching strategy for coordinate transformations
   
2. **Day 5**: Implement optimizations
   - Create dataset-level transformation caching
   - Implement shared coordinate transformation for duplicate reference frames
   - Move transformation calculations out of hot path (`__getitem__`)
   - Add performance benchmarks to validate improvements

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Dataset-level coordinate transformation caching implemented
- [ ] Duplicate reference frame transformations shared/reused
- [ ] Measurable performance improvement (benchmark required)
- [ ] TODO comment resolved with proper architecture
- [ ] No regression in transformation accuracy

## P0 Issue #3: NaN Handling Hack in RandomContrast Transform

### Location
- **File**: `src/cellmap_data/transforms/augment/random_contrast.py` (line 40)

### Problem Description
The `RandomContrast` transform contains a hack that uses `torch.nan_to_num` to avoid NaNs without addressing the root cause. This can mask underlying data quality issues and produce incorrect augmentations.

### Code Context
```python
# Line 35-41 in random_contrast.py
result = (
    (ratio * x + (1.0 - ratio) * x.mean(dim=0, keepdim=True))
    .clamp(0, bound)
    .to(x.dtype)
)
# Hack to avoid NaNs
torch.nan_to_num(result, nan=0.0, posinf=0.0, neginf=0.0, out=result)
return result
```

### Impact
- **Severity**: P0 Critical
- **Data Quality**: Can silently convert meaningful NaN values to 0, corrupting augmentation
- **Debugging**: Masks underlying issues in contrast calculation
- **Training Impact**: May introduce artifacts in augmented training data

### Root Cause Analysis Required
1. **Investigation needed**: Under what conditions does the contrast calculation produce NaNs?
2. **Possible causes**:
   - Division by zero when `x.mean()` is zero or very small
   - Input data containing NaNs/infs that propagate through calculation
   - Numerical instability in ratio calculations
   - Type conversion issues

### Resolution Strategy (Day 5)
1. **Root cause analysis**:
   - Add logging to identify when/why NaNs occur
   - Test with edge case inputs (all zeros, extreme values, existing NaNs)
   - Analyze mathematical conditions causing NaN generation

2. **Proper fix implementation**:
   - Add input validation for problematic data conditions
   - Handle edge cases mathematically instead of post-processing
   - Implement proper error handling with informative messages
   - Add option to preserve meaningful NaNs vs replacing with default values

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Root cause of NaN generation identified
- [ ] Proper mathematical handling implemented (no hack)
- [ ] Input validation added for edge cases
- [ ] Hack code removed
- [ ] Unit tests added for edge cases (all zeros, existing NaNs, etc.)
- [ ] Augmentation quality preserved without artifacts
