# Priority 4: Validation & Configuration - Complete

This phase focused on improving the robustness of the `cellmap-data` package by introducing a structured and centralized validation system for all configuration objects.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Schema-Based Validation with Pydantic

- **Dependency**: Added `pydantic` to the project to leverage its powerful data validation capabilities.
- **Schema Definitions**: Created `src/cellmap_data/validation/schemas.py` to house all Pydantic models for our configuration objects:
    - `DatasetConfig`: For `CellMapDataset`.
    - `DataLoaderConfig`: For `CellMapDataLoader`.
    - `DataSplitConfig`: For `CellMapDataSplit`.
- **Centralized Validator**: Refactored `src/cellmap_data/validation/validation.py` to use the new Pydantic schemas within the `ConfigValidator` class. This replaces manual, scattered validation checks with a single, reliable source of truth.

### 2. Integration with Core Classes

- The `ConfigValidator` is now called within the `__init__` methods of `CellMapDataset` and `CellMapDataSplit`.
- This ensures that any instance of these classes is created with a valid configuration, preventing runtime errors due to misconfigured parameters.

### 3. Command-Line Interface (CLI) for Validation

- **New Module**: Created `src/cellmap_data/cli.py`.
- **`validate` Command**: Implemented a `cellmap-data validate <file_path>` command that allows users to check the validity of their JSON configuration files before using them in a script.
- **Entry Point**: Registered the CLI in `pyproject.toml`, making it available after package installation.

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

- **New Test File**: Added `tests/test_validation.py` to unit-test the `ConfigValidator` and the Pydantic schemas with both valid and invalid configurations.
- **CLI Testing**: Manually verified that the `validate` command correctly identifies valid and invalid configuration files and provides informative error messages.

This work makes the package significantly more user-friendly and easier to debug by catching configuration errors early and providing clear feedback.
