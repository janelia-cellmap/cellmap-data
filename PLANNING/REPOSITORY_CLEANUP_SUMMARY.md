## Next Steps
1. ✅ **Immediate**: Repository is clean and organized
2. 🔄 **Ongoing**: Run cleanup script periodically
3. 📝 **Future**: Archive completed planning documents when major phases finish
4. 🔧 **As needed**: Add new development scripts to `scripts/` directory

The repository is now well-organized with clear separation of concerns and automated maintenance tools!
