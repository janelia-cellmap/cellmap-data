## ðŸš€ Week 5-6: Performance & Architecture Objectives

### **Primary Focus: Performance Optimization**

Based on the planning documents and P0 issue analysis, Week 5-6 will address the critical performance bottlenecks identified during the foundation phase:

#### **Week 5: Core Performance Optimization**

##### **Day 1-2: Coordinate Transformation Architecture**
**Priority**: P0 Critical (dataset.py line 524)

**Objective**: Resolve major performance bottleneck from per-item coordinate transformations

**Current Problem**:
```python
# Line 524 in dataset.py __getitem__ method - PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECK
# TODO: Should do as many coordinate transformations as possible at the dataset level 
# (duplicate reference frame images should have the same coordinate transformations) 
# --> do this per array, perhaps with CellMapArray object
```

**Tasks**:
1. **Root Cause Analysis**: Profile current transformation pipeline performance
2. **Architecture Design**: Implement dataset-level transformation caching
3. **CellMapArray Implementation**: Create optimized array object as suggested in TODO
4. **Shared Transformations**: Eliminate duplicate calculations for reference frames
5. **Performance Validation**: Benchmark improvements with measurable metrics

**Success Criteria**:
- Measurable performance improvement (3x+ speedup target)
- Coordinate transformations moved from hot path (`__getitem__`)
- Duplicate reference frame transformations cached/shared
- TODO comment resolved with proper architecture
- Zero regression in transformation accuracy

##### **Day 3-4: Memory Usage Optimization**
**Priority**: P2 Medium (validation module focus)

**Objective**: Optimize memory consumption and resource management

**Tasks**:
1. **Memory Profiling**: Identify high-memory usage patterns
2. **Resource Management**: Improve memory allocation strategies

**Current State**:
- `CellMapDataset`: 941 lines (target: ~300 lines per class)
- `CellMapImage`: 537 lines (target: ~200 lines per class)

**Tasks**:
1. **Device Management Extraction**: Create centralized `DeviceManager` class
2. **Coordinate Transform Separation**: Extract to dedicated `CoordinateTransformer`
3. **Data Loading Logic**: Separate into specialized `DataLoader` classes
