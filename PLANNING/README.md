## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

This refactoring project follows a systematic approach:

1. **Week 1**: ‚úÖ Foundation stabilization (P0 critical issues)
2. **Week 2**: üîÑ API consistency and error handling (P1 high priority)
3. **Week 3-4**: Code quality and consistency improvements
4. **Week 5-8**: Performance optimization and final validation

All planning documents are kept current and reflect actual implementation decisions and outcomes.
